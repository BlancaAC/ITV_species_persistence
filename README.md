# Data and code for: Integrating intraspecific variation into population dynamics reveals how interacting species persist in mutualistic communities

All the data and code required to replicate the results of the empirical case study are available in this repository. The /Data folder contains .csv files with the plant-pollinator interaction matrix, plant traits, and plant fitness data. To re-run the analyses, run each script in sequence (prefixed 01 to 05). All results can be generated by running the following scripts:

- 01_mutualistic_benefits_workflow.R: this code calculates the mutualistic benefits received by plant individuals from pollinator species based on plant fitness data. These empirically estimated mutualistic benefits are used to parameterized gamma coefficient in the next script.
- 02_dynamics_workflow.R: this code builds all interaction matrices at the plant population and community levels and contains all analyses on the dynamics of empirical mutualistic assemblages.
